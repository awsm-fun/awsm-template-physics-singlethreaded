//! Audio — plays the awsm-audio export and drives it from gameplay.
//!
//! Everything is on the main thread (WebAudio, and thus
//! [`awsm_audio_player::Player`], is main-thread only). The physics step decides
//! *when* the ball rolls / hits a wall / lands and how loud (it owns the
//! contacts) and pushes [`AudioMsg`] cues; the game loop drains them into
//! [`AudioController::on_audio`], which turns each into live WebAudio changes.
//!
//! **One `Player`, one `AudioContext`, many concurrent voices** (the mixer model
//! awsm-audio-player 2.5 added). The three SFX share the player's master bus:
//!   * **roll** — a sustaining DSP-worklet rumble. It's the player's persistent
//!     `play()` instance (looping), so it's never cut; loudness + timbre + 3D
//!     position are driven continuously with `set_param_live`.
//!   * **wall hit** / **land** — one-shots fired as independent **voices**
//!     (`play_voice_with`). A voice doesn't stop the roll or each other, and its
//!     per-trigger statics (intensity → gain, hardness → filter cutoff, table
//!     position → stage panner) are baked in as build-time **overrides**, so the
//!     sound is correct from its very first sample. A spent one-shot self-decays
//!     to silence but its source nodes (oscillators) keep running until freed, so
//!     we [`stop_voice`] each once its tail has finished — otherwise they pile up
//!     into a constant hum. A `max_voices` cap is the backstop.
//!
//! [`stop_voice`]: awsm_audio_player::Player::stop_voice
//!
//! The export ships `.wav` bounces too, but these SFX are synthesized live, so
//! the only asset we fetch is the rolling-sound `.wasm` worklet.
//!
//! ## Live controls (what the game drives at runtime)
//!
//! | sound | node (label)        | param        | driven by                       |
//! |-------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
//! | roll  | worklet             | `speed`      | normalized roll speed 0..1      |
//! | roll  | `roll_LEVEL`        | `gain`       | roll speed (0 ⇒ silent at rest) |
//! | roll  | `roll_PANNER`       | `positionXYZ`| ball position → audio stage     |
//! | hit   | `hit_LEVEL`         | `gain`       | impact intensity 0..1           |
//! | hit   | `hit_FILTER`        | `frequency`  | impact intensity (harder⇒brighter)|
//! | hit   | `hit_PANNER`        | `positionXYZ`| impact position → audio stage   |
//! | land  | `land_LEVEL`        | `gain`       | landing intensity 0..1          |
//! | land  | `land_FILTER`       | `frequency`  | landing intensity               |
//! | land  | `land_PANNER`       | `positionXYZ`| landing position → audio stage  |
//!
//! The roll's columns are nudged live (`set_param_live`); the impacts' are passed
//! as `play_voice_with` overrides at trigger time. All the per-sound worklet/DSP
//! knobs (`roughness`, `body_hz`, `brightness`, impact mode tunings, …) keep
//! their authored values; only the columns above are touched at runtime.
//!
//! ## Spatialization: an orbiting listener over a tabletop stage
//!
//! The listener is NOT placed at the literal (far-away, steeply-tilted) camera —
//! from 9 units back the whole table subtends a narrow cone and the pan goes
//! mushy. Instead, sources sit at the ball's **world (x, z) on the felt**
//! ([`stage_pos`]), and a **virtual listener hovers low over the table**, orbited
//! around the table center at the camera's azimuth (yaw) and looking inward —
//! see [`listener`]. We borrow only the camera's *heading*, never its distance
//! or pitch, so rail-to-rail still pans near-hard L/R while the stereo image
//! tracks the view from any angle. Main re-sends the listener on every orbit
//! drag via `set_listener_live`, which moves the real `AudioListener` — so the
//! engine re-spatializes **every ringing voice**, and a one-shot fired before
//! you orbit swings correctly as you move. The ball's own y is ignored — it
//! only sounds while on the surface.
